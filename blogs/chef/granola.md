# Granola - a broad framework to follow
Granola is surprisingly easy to make. Toss some stuff together and toss it in the oven for a bit. Here's the recipe I started with and some learnings I found along the way.

## Ingredients
1. Oats - 3 cups
1. Almonds, sliced - half a cup
1. Pumpkin seeds - just under half a cup, but more than a third of a cup
1. Flaked, unsweetened coconut - maybe three quarters of a cup
1. Cranberries, dried, chopped up coarsely - maybe half a cup?
1. Apricots, dried, chopped up coarsely - maybe half a cup?
1. Maple syrup -  maybe a third of a cup?
1. Butter, unsalted - a tablespook or two
1. Cinnamon, ground - a teaspoon?
1. Oil, relatively flavourless - a quarter cup? A little less?

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 160c
1. Mix together the oats, nuts and coconut flakes, set aside in a bowl
1. Melt butter, mix in maple syrup, oil and cinnamon until consistent
1. Mix syrup into the dry ingredients
1. Toss until even

## Toasting
- Spread evenly onto a baking tray and toss it into the oven for about 20 minutes. Check often, and shake it around as needed.
- Close When you feel it's close to getting done, you can turn on the top element (broil setting) for a minute or two to give it some smokiness. Don't let it burn, just brown.
- Pull it out of the oven to cool down and toss in your chopped up dried fruits.

## Learnings
- You don't want to put your dried cranberries and apricots into the oven for very long. They get extremely dry and hard. If that's what you're going for, then play around with the time. I left mine in for about half the oven time, which was too much.
- A little cinnamon goes a long way. 
- Go cooler and longer rather than hotter and quicker.
