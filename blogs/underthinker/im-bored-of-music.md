# I'm bored of music
I can't be sure why. Most of the music I still like are from my past. Music I listened to on long car rides in the passenger's seat of my mum's car as a child. Music that surprised me when I first first heard it years ago...

I don't think I'm particularly optinionated about music. I just want it to not be boring. I've never been an afficianado of anything, except "Green Day" when I was 11. I never loved a particular genre. I am susceptible to falling into a single genre for a while though. I think that's part of the problem.

I find something I like, over-consume it, enabled by the amazingly tuned spotify "algorithm" and then I'm done. Like a binge-eater, I no longer enjoy what I'm shoving down my gullet, but I have nothing else to do.

I think I need to take a step away from music. Or at least thinking about music. I need to detach myself from the process, and hopefully find myself casually bopping my head to a new beat.

I don't know how I'm going to get a steady feed of music without going actively looking for it. Maybe "radios" of a song I like? Not commit too hard, like songs occasionally and move on?

I don't know. Let's try it. I'll be back again with an update someday.

PS: This is the only line in my file that doesn't start with an I. Narcissitic much?
