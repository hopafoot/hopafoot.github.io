# The fear of the impossible
_I'm starting to notice something strange... I'm starting to notice that I'm not afraid to start things anymore._

## What am I doing...

When I first started working on what was then a simple project and is not Port I was completely unprepared. Nothing felt within reach. I had just dived chest first off the 20 foot board and wsa consistently bracing for the sharp slap of the frigid water below.

I was still in university. I had been in 2 hackathons, made some crappy projects, had a small internship or two. I was not a full-stack developer. I knew nothing about cryptography. I didn't know the first thing about app-development. I could maybe make a few un-educated guesses, but that was it.

## I'm going to let everyone down...

It started with just my partner and I. I was afraid my inexperience would let him down. Quickly we got our first designer on board. Now I had a second person to let down. We stayed at this size for a bit, and I was flailing. We were still small, we didn't have many others that we NEEDED to answer to, but I was already a ball of stress. Before long we started building out an prototype of our app. I did so many things wrong... That's okay though. That's what prototypes are for. Suddenly we had an angel investor see potential in us. I'm still not entirely sure why, but they did.

We quickly hired a couple of new-grads to get the ball rolling. In hindsight, this wasn't the best decision. It just added more pressure, and in such an early stage, while we were still sorting out the basics, it just added more noise. Regardless, these new-grads had no expreience, but just by virtue of having graduated from university already, they were more senior than me. I was now terrified of being wrong and looking stupid in front of my teammates, yes, but also the people who I had hired. I defered to their judgement and gave them responsibilites that shouldn't have been theirs. I couldn't let them down if I didn't do anything controversial.

## Getting in the groove

Over time my instincts started kicking in. I noticed that I could make choices that didn't bite us in the butt as often as the others did. This might have just been my awesome design vision and technical know-how but it actually had to do with the fact that I knew where we were going, because I decided where we go.

I didn't fully appreciate the insight that being the person in charge gave me. It lets me have an intuition about things that other people just don't have the opportunity to develop.

I realized that even though I was the youngest at the company, I was still a founder god dammit! I was not incompetent. I was not perfect, but I didn't have to be perfect either.

## Owning the unknown

I've done this a little longer than I thought I'd survive at the start. I still constantly feel like I don't know how to start. Somewhere along the way I built my confidence up. I no longer feel like an imposter. Occasionally I feel like I'm the best, but a silly bug that I introduce quickly tears down that hubris.

I seem to have this blind confidence that I can solve a problem when it comes up. I usually do, but sometimes I don't. I can forgive myself when I don't. I need this confidence to keep going and if I'm being honest, for the most part, it's worked out. I don't think I'm special with this, I think that having some blind faith in yourself is a good thing when you're being ambitious. This needs to come with self-forgiveness in order to keep pushing past mistakes. God knows I've made mistakes and I can promise you that I'll make so many more. Let's just hope that none of them bury this dream of mine, and hopefully I can forgive myself if it does.
