# Welcome to my blogs
Why do people blog? I can't answer for everyone else, but I hope that it helps me gather my thoughts from time to time. I don't know if this will help or not, but that won't stop me from trying,

## What can you expect to find here?
I don't know what you'll see from me going forward, but for now, you should see things organised into a couple of broad sections.

### The ruminations of a self-proclaimed CTO
As you probably don't know - due to my complete lack of presence in most peoples' lives - I became a self proclaimed CTO while still in University. I wanted to change the world, the way people communicate, so I started a company with a friend, Since, I have had no idea what I was doing, so here we are. My blogs.

### The dubious preparations of a self-proclaimed sustenance chef
I cook to eat and, much to the confusion of the people around me, I like the process of cooking just as much as I enjoy eating my food. I sometimes do alright, but I eat what I cook even if it looks more like kibble than kibble itself. Contained within this digital log, you may find some of my successes as well as my failures because who learns to sautee mustard seeds until they splatter faster than someone who has had to chomp down on copious quantities of raw, bitter bombs?

## How often do I add more blogs?
When I feel like it. Go away. I'm not a "content creator".

## Can I get notified of new blogs?
No. Why would you want to?
